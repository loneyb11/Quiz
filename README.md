I started off great with the homework but then hit a wall.  I wasn't sure about the structure of some of the Javascript and not paying attention to syntax. Re-did the quiz by watching videos on youTube and Udemy.  Have a better understanding but need more work. 

James Quick videos helped step by step.  I had to change things up as I was not storing the questions in a seperate JSON file using an API.  I learnt more skills but by no means have I mastered them.  

I struggled with the timer and logging the score correctly but vow to fix.
