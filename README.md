# Quiz
This is homework for Coding Bootcamp

I started off great with the homework but then hit a wall.  I wasn't sure about the structure of some of the Javascript and not paying attention to syntax. Re-did the quiz by watching videos on youTube and Udemy.  Have a better understanding but need more work.
